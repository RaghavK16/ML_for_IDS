# ML_for_IDS

This project involves training supervised machine learning models to create an **Intrusion Detection System**, with more than 90% accuracy.

## Prerequisite

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the JupyterLab or the classic Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
